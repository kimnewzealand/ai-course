# Integrate the learning experience with reflection

1. Were you able to successfully get your assistant to pick up where you left off (with an empty context window) with just "what's the next step?" or "what is our status?"
2. Were you able to get your assistant to behave properly during the transitions?
3. Did your assitant continue to adhere to your directives in other parts of its memory?
4. What was a behaviour that your assistant took a lot of work to get right?

Before the next time we meet, please post a link to your repo and your reflections to Discord.
