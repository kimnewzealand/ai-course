I need help creating a comprehensive implementation plan for an enhanced admin web interface that supports the existing REST Web API. Please review the following specifications and create a detailed plan that includes dependencies with specific versions, file/folder structure, architectural patterns, code examples, testing strategy, and developer experience improvements. You must strictly adhere to ALL of the details provided below and not add any additional dependencies or features without explicit approval. If anything is unclear or you need more information, please ask for clarification.

## Technical Specifications

### Programming Language
- **Choice**: TypeScript (for logic), HTML (for structure), CSS (for styling)

### Dependencies
Use pnpm to manage dependencies and run scripts.
Use specific library versions:

### Web Framework
- **Framework**: Vanilla TypeScript/HTML/CSS
- **Browser API**: Only use the `fetch` feature of modern browsers
- **No Frameworks**: Do not use React, Vue, Angular, or any other frontend frameworks

### API Integration
Use the REST API endpoints available at `http://localhost:8000`:
- `GET /items` - List all items with pagination
- `POST /items` - Create new item
- `GET /items/{id}` - Get specific item by ID
- `PUT /items/{id}` - Update existing item
- `DELETE /items/{id}` - Delete item by ID
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### Features Required
- **Item Management**: Complete CRUD interface for items
  - List items in a table with pagination
  - Create new items with form validation
  - Edit existing items with pre-populated forms
  - Delete items with confirmation
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation matching API constraints
- **User Feedback**: Success/error notifications and loading states
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Input Validation
- **Name**: Required, 1-100 characters
- **Description**: Optional, 0-500 characters
- **ID**: Auto-generated by API

### Testing
- **Unit Testing**: vitest for component logic and utilities
- **Integration Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end user workflows
- **Coverage**: Tests for all CRUD operations, validation, and UI interactions

### Project Files
Create and populate the following files:
- `README.md` with setup, run, test, and development instructions
- `.env` template with API base URL
- `.gitignore` for web development artifacts
- `package.json` with pnpm scripts and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration
- `vite.config.ts` for development server
- `vitest.config.ts` for unit testing
- `playwright.config.ts` for e2e testing

### Developer Experience
- **Linting**: ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking and modern ES features
- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with live updates
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites with multiple browsers
- **Build Process**: Optimized production builds

### Deployment
- **Local Development**: Designed for local testing and development
- **Build Process**: pnpm-based build scripts
- **Static Hosting**: Can be deployed to any static web server
- **API Proxy**: Configurable API base URL for different environments

## Additional Requirements
- Add comprehensive error handling for network failures and API errors
- Implement accessible form controls and keyboard navigation
- Use modern CSS with custom properties and responsive grid layouts
- Provide clear loading states and user feedback
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Follow web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
- Optimize bundle size and loading performance
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels where needed

## API Data Models

**Item Structure**:
```typescript
interface Item {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at?: string;
}

interface ItemCreate {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
}

interface ItemUpdate {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
}
```

**API Response Format**:
- Success: `{ data: Item }` or `{ data: Item[] }`
- Error: `{ error: "Error message" }`
- Status codes: 200 (success), 404 (not found), 422 (validation error)

## UI Components

**Required Components**:
- Item list table with action buttons
- Create/edit item form with validation
- Navigation between list and form views
- Notification system for user feedback
- Loading indicators for async operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Styling Requirements

- Clean, professional design
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Hover states and focus indicators
- Error states with clear visual feedback
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Dark/light theme support (optional)

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for large item lists
- Debounced form validation
- Efficient re-rendering of dynamic content
- Minimal bundle size with tree shaking
- Caching strategies for API responses

Please provide a complete implementation plan that covers:

1. Project structure (folders and files for a web application)
2. Dependencies (pnpm packages for TypeScript, testing, linting)
3. Component architecture and file organization
4. API integration patterns using fetch
5. Form handling and validation
6. Error handling and user feedback
7. Testing strategy with vitest and Playwright
8. Build and development setup
9. File contents and configuration details

Ensure the plan follows modern web development best practices, provides excellent developer experience, and creates a maintainable admin interface for the REST API.
