# Integrate your learning experience with reflection

1. Which MCP servers did you attempt to use? Were you unsuccessful with any of them? Why?
2. Did you install any local servers? Docker or on the metal? What are your reflections between the two?
3. Which MCP servers do you suspect would be useful to run locally? What about remotely and/or team shared?
4. Are there any obvious candidates for useful MCP servers in your organisation? Is this supporting an existing need, or a new opportunity?

Before the next time we meet, please post a link to your repo and your reflections to Discord.
